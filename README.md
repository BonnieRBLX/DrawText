# DrawText
DrawText is a simple library which is creating a TextLabel. It's like ```Drawing.new("Text")``` but has UDim2 Options instead of Vector2 Options.
To use the script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("raw.githubusercontent.com/BonnieRBLX/DrawText/main/main.luau"))("BonnieRBLX")
```
And after executing the script, you can use the ```DrawText``` library. Documentation: ```https//github.com/BonnieRBLX/DrawText/main/documentation.md```
